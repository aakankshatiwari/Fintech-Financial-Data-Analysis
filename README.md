Project Overview – A general snapshot of the firm's financial health and key metrics, focusing on revenue streams, operational expenses, and profitability trends.

In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis divided into three key sections:

1. Customer Segmentation – An in-depth analysis of customer groups based on various features such as spending patterns, product usage, and lifetime value, enabling personalized strategies.
2. Strategy Evaluation – A comparison of different business strategies, including the impact of AI integration on operational efficiency, cost reduction, and customer retention rates.
3. Forecasting & Modeling – Using regression, classification, and clustering models, I forecasted revenue, classified high-value customers, and identified trends that drive business growth.

This project showcases my ability to leverage data analytics, feature engineering, and machine learning to derive meaningful insights and support business decision-making. The breakdown offers a deep dive into how AI can drive growth and optimize financial strategies in a fintech environment.
